        <h3>
          The Golden Retriever breed has been around since the early 1830s
        </h3>
        <p>
          In fact, Golden Retriever facts will reveal to you that this beautiful
          dog even has aristocratic roots. It was Dudley Coutts Marjoribanks who
          developed the Golden Retriever in Scotland during the
          mid-to-late-1800s. A flat-coated retriever and Tweed water spaniel
          were bred to bring about the Golden Retriever. The Golden Retriever
          was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1925 as a registered
          breed.

          Adult male golden retrievers grow to be 65–75 pounds, while females
          are 55–65 pounds. Their coloring ranges from light golden to cream,
          and dark golden to golden, and their physique can vary from broad and
          dense to leaner and more sporty. According to AKC standards, goldens
          move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried,
          as breed fanciers say, with a "merry action."

          In general, golden retrievers are outgoing, playful, and gentle. They
          are also friendly, intelligent, and devoted. "Golden retrievers are
          special because they are the perfect family dog," Ryan Steen, DVM,
          medical director at Frey Pet Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, says.
          "From a personality perspective, you'll be hard pressed to find a more
          loving, outgoing, eager-to-please companion." Early in their lives,
          they are perfect for playing with children in the backyard. As they
          get older, most golden retrievers become docile and calm.
